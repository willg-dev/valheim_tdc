# SmoothServer

Networking and performance tuning for Valheim dedicated servers — **and, since 0.3.0, an optional
client half in the same DLL**.

The server half is the point of the mod and it still needs **zero client installs**:
`[General] EnforceClientMod` defaults to `false`, so vanilla players can always join. Install the
same package on players' machines as well and you additionally get packet compression, a client
send budget and a server-wide shared map.

## Installing

**Server admins** — install into the *server's* profile
(`BepInEx/plugins/SmoothServer/`). Everything under "Server modules" below starts working
immediately; nobody has to install anything. Config file: `Nosferatu.SmoothServer.cfg` in the
server's `BepInEx/config/`.

**Players** — install into your own profile only if the server also runs SmoothServer 0.3.0+.
`[General] Mode` is `Auto`: a dedicated server runs the server half, your game runs the client
half. You get compression, the client send budget and the shared map; server-owned settings are
pushed to you by the server.

**The package contains six DLLs**, not one: `SmoothServer.dll` plus `ZstdSharp.dll`,
`System.Memory.dll`, `System.Buffers.dll`, `System.Numerics.Vectors.dll` and
`System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll` (the zstd codec and its dependencies — none ship
with Valheim or BepInEx). A mod manager handles this; hand-installers must copy all six.

## Mods this replaces — uninstall them first

| Uninstall | Replaced by | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CW_Jesse / BetterNetworking** | `Compression` + `SteamRates` + `SendQueueGuard` | server **and** clients |
| **Mydayyy / ServerSideMap** | `SharedMap` | server **and** clients |

Both must go from *every* machine. If BetterNetworking is still installed, `Compression` refuses
to patch (`FAILED(...)` in the module summary) and the rest of SmoothServer loads normally — it
will not break your server, it just will not compress. SharedMap imports an existing
`<world>.mod.serversidemap.explored` file once on first start, so no exploration is lost.

## Server modules

Each module has its own `Enabled` toggle in its config section.

- **Telemetry** `[Telemetry]` — periodic fps / frame-time / ZDO-rate log line. No gameplay effect.
- **FrameRate** `[FrameRate]` — raises the dedicated server's Unity frame cap. 60 is a good
  default on modern hardware: roughly +4pp of one CPU core for half the tick latency.
- **SendCadence** `[SendCadence]` — sends ZDO updates to every peer on a fixed interval
  (`SendHz`, default 20) instead of vanilla's one-peer-per-frame round robin. Scales with player count.
- **SendBudget** `[SendBudget]` — the ZDO send-queue high-water mark and minimum chunk size,
  exposed as config: `HighWaterBytes` defaults to 65536 (vanilla 10240), `MinChunkBytes` to 2048
  (same as vanilla). Acts as the fallback when AdaptiveBudget is off.
- **CreateBudget** `[CreateBudget]` — objects created per frame, exposed as config (default
  matches vanilla, i.e. a no-op until raised).
- **PeerTelemetry** `[PeerTelemetry]` — per-peer ping, throughput and Steam send-queue sampling.
  No patches; feeds AdaptiveBudget.
- **AdaptiveBudget** `[AdaptiveBudget]` — a *per-peer* send budget from each peer's measured
  bandwidth-delay product, clamped, EMA-smoothed, and backed off while Steam's pending byte count
  says the pipe is congested. A player on fibre next door and one on satellite no longer share
  one number.
- **SteamRates** `[SteamRates]` — raises Steam's `SendRateMax` (default 1 MB/s).
  `SendRateMin` stays at vanilla on purpose: it is a floor on Steam's own bandwidth *estimate*,
  and raising it stops the congestion controller backing off for weak connections.
- **SendQueueGuard** `[SendQueueGuard]` — defers, never drops, while a peer's Steam send queue is
  backed up, and survives the Steamworks throws that can occur mid-handshake.
- **SyncListCache** `[SyncListCache]` — caches the per-peer sector scan in `ZDOMan.CreateSyncList`
  briefly; the filter and sort still run on every send.
- **VPOServer** `[VPOServer]` — the server-safe parts of ValheimPerformanceOptimizations (MIT):
  `WearNTear` support caching and a faster `ReleaseNearbyZDOS` scan.
- **AsyncSave** `[AsyncSave]` — pre-sizes the save clone list. Measured on a 136 000-ZDO world,
  main-thread autosave stall **67 ms → 47 ms** and **78 ms → 45 ms**.
- **GcThrottle** `[GcThrottle]` — rate-limits `Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets` on an idle server.
- **OwnershipRelease** `[OwnershipRelease]` — shortens the ZDO ownership-release interval from
  vanilla's 2 s (default 0.5 s) so objects change hands faster as players move.
- **MapSelfTest** `[MapSelfTest]` — headless unit tests for the shared-map codec at load; shows up
  as `applied  PASS` in the module summary.
- **StatsLog** `[StatsLog]` — writes `stats-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (fps/frame time, ZDO counts,
  per-peer network/budget/compression state) every `IntervalSec` (default 10s) and
  `events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (joins/leaves, save stalls, GC sweeps, AdaptiveBudget backoff
  transitions, SendQueueGuard drops, config reloads) as they happen, to
  `BepInEx/config/smoothserver/stats/` by default. Rotates daily, prunes past `RetentionDays`
  (default 30). Run `tools/analyze.py` against a few days of these files for a markdown report —
  see the repo's `tools/README.md`.

## What the client half adds

- **Compression** `[Compression]` — *both ends*. zstd over Steam sockets using
  BetterNetworking's trained dictionaries, with an explicit per-message frame tag and an
  `SS_Caps`/`SS_Ready` capability handshake, so the receiver always knows whether a message is
  compressed. Peers without the mod stay uncompressed with no penalty. Typical self-test ratio on
  real ZDO traffic: **~8 %** of the original size.
- **SharedMap** `[Map]` — *both ends*. The whole server shares map exploration and pins. The store
  is bit-packed and compressed (**1.7 KB** where ServerSideMap wrote **4.2 MB** for the same
  world), the map size is read from your client rather than hardcoded, and updates are batched at
  1 Hz into sparse chunks instead of one RPC per explored pixel. Merging goes through vanilla
  `Minimap.Explore`, so shared terrain bakes into your own map file and nothing is lost if the
  module is turned off. Pin sharing is configurable per pin type; death pins are off by default.
- **ClientNet** `[Client]` — *client only*. Your client's own ZDO send high-water mark (default
  48 KB, vanilla 10 KB) and Steam `SendRateMax`. Inactive on a dedicated server.

## Config

One file, `Nosferatu.SmoothServer.cfg`. Edits are picked up live on a running server
(`[General] HotReload`) — no restart. Settings the server owns are pushed to clients that run the
mod (ServerSync); `[General]` entries stay machine-local.
